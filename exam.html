            The pandemic has changed our lives in various ways. We have no alternative but to change our lifestyle according to the rules and preventive measures taken up by the government. These changes include online education. <br><br>
            Educational institutions are closed. Earlier, this would have meant that students could not receive education any longer. However, we have found a way out of this through technology. Using technology as a key, we have opened the lock of a more convenient educational system. However, a question is still left unanswered : is online education a boon or a curse?<br><br>
            <h1 class="sec-head">Merits of Online Education</h1>
            <h3 class="tri-head">1. Convenient and cheap</h3>
            The first merit is that it is convenient and  cheap. Students can send files to their teachers through the internet, which requires only a device and a strong internet connection. It is convenient and cheaper too as we don’t require a vehicle to go from one place to another. We don’t even have to spend a huge amount of money on the stationery as we are getting the information from teachers from which we get printouts. Moreover, the study hours have become flexible which has made education relaxing. <br><br>
            <h1 class="tri-head">2. Faster</h1>
            Second : it is faster. We can send many files at once in just a few minutes! This also results in the third merit. <br><br>
            <h1 class="tri-head">3. Decrease in workload</h1>
            It has decreased the workload of teachers. To check answer sheets of exams, they just have to enter the answers of the questions and the computer evaluates the marks itself. Moreover, they can send edited files of the students, in which they can just highlight the mistakes so the students themselves can correct it. <br><br><br>
            <h1 class="sec-head">Demerits of online education</h1>
            <h1 class="tri-head">1. Poor connectivity</h1>
            The first disadvantage is : poor internet connection and inaccessibility of different devices for video calls makes it hard for children to study. This can be applied in case of teachers also, especially for those who aren’t technically sound. <br><br>
            <h1 class="tri-head">2. Distractions</h1>
            Second : devices are used not only for online education but for recreational activities. So, most of the students can’t focus on their studies as they are constantly distracted by their favourite movies, web series, games, songs, memes and many more notifications. <br><br>
            <h1 class="tri-head">3. Technical glitches</h1>
            Third demerit is : technical difficulties give teachers and students a hard time. Technical errors were quite normal before. However, since electronics have become a major part of our day-to-day life, such glitches become unbearable to us. Same goes for students and teachers as well. Teachers are sometimes unable to send messages or upload homework. Similarly, students are sometimes unable to open or send some files. <br><br>
            <h1 class="sec-head">Conclusion</h1>
            Now, let’s do a recap : we have learnt that there are five merits and six demerits of online education. However, in my opinion, online education is a boon for us, especially for students. If a student drafts a perfectly balanced time-table and follows it diligently, he or she can avoid many demerits and the student can maintain their health and pass with flying colours simultaneously. <br><br>
